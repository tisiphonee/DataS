    "The code utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation technique to estimate the value of π. This involves generating random points within a quarter circle inscribed in a square. The pi_estimator function is responsible for calculating the ratio of points within the circle, providing approximate values for π based on different quantities of generated points (ranging from ${10^3}$ to ${10^8}$). Notably, as the number of points increases, the precision of the π approximation improves. This highlight the method's effectiveness in converging towards the true value of Pi as the sample size grows.\n",
